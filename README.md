SIMPLE ASSEMBLER

      This code converts assembly language code to machine code
      
      It is capabale of: 
      1.  Handling all instructions
      2.  Showing errors with line numbers
      3.  Handling labels and variables
      Please refer to Q1 of COPROJECT2022.pdf for more details
      
SIMPLE SIMULATOR

      This code takes machine language as input and gives program counter, register value, flag value as output
      
      It is capabale of:
      1. Handling branching conditions
      2. Handling overflow and underflow cases
      3. Calculating value of registers and flag in each step
      Please refer to Q2 of COPROJECT2022.pdf for more details
      
MODIFIED ASSEMBLER Q3 

      This code converts assembly language code to machine code while handling floating point numbers
      
      Along with the functions of SimpleAssembler, this code can handle floating point numbers. Their arithmetic operations, overflow and underflow cases 
      Please refer to Q3 of COPROJECT2022.pdf for more details
      
MODIFIED SIMULATOR Q3

      This code extends the functionality of SimpleSimulator to floating point numbers.
      
      Please refer to Q3 of COPROJECT2022.pdf for more details
      
GRAPH SIMULATOR Q4

      This code extends the functionality of ModifiesSimulator to plotting a graph showing the memory accesed at different cycles.
      It plots a graph between 'Memory' and 'Cycles'.
      
      Please refer to Q4 of COPROJECT2022.pdf for more details
      
QUESTION 5

      This code takes input of 2 types from the user and calculates accordingly and then provides solution to the queries given to it.
      
      Queries of type-1 include :  
          1. Number of bits required for OPCODE
          2. Maximum numbers of instructions the given ISA can support
          3. Maximum number of registers this ISA can support
          4. Number of filler bits in Instruction type 2
          5. How many  minimum bits are needed to represent an address in the given architecture
          
      Queries of type-2 include:
          1. How many address pins are saved or required (indicate saved by[- how many ever we don't need] and +[by how many more we need])
          
      Please refer to Q5 of COPROJECT2022.pdf for more details
